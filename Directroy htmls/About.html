      It is designed to showcase my understanding of
      <em><big>HTML</big></em> fundamentals and the structure of modern
      websites. Through this platform, I aim to demonstrate not only my ability
      to create clean, semantic <em><big>HTML</big></em> but also my attention
      to layout, accessibility and usability principles that are essential for
      building user-friendly web experiences. Each page and feature has been
      crafted with the intention of exploring different
      <em><big>HTML</big></em> elements, linking strategies and content
      organization techniques, allowing me to experiment and reinforce my
      knowledge. Additionally, this website acts as a living record of my
      progress in web development, documenting the challenges I encounter and
      the solutions I implement. By navigating through the portfolio, visitors
      can observe how I structure content logically, use headings and paragraphs
      effectively and link pages in a cohesive manner, all while maintaining a
      visually coherent and functional design. Ultimately, this project
      represents a combination of learning, creativity and practical
      application, serving both as a personal reference and as a showcase for
      potential opportunities in <mark>web development.</mark>
